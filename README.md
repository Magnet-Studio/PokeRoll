## ℹ️ What is PokéRoll? ℹ️
PokéRoll is a browser game that started out as a group project in university studies with the intention of learning and meeting the standards of user interfaces.<br/>
We are currently looking to expand our project so that it can be everything we originally wanted but were unable to achieve.<br/>
Visit the deployed project and enjoy the experience yourself!
